# UnionFindDelete
A Simple and Efficient Union-Find-Delete Algorithm
The Unionâ€“Find data structure for maintaining disjoint sets is one of the best known and widespread data structures, in particular the version with constant-time Union and efficient Find. 
Recently, the question of how to handle deletions from the structure in an efficient manner has been taken up, first by Kaplan et al. (2002) [2] and subsequently by Alstrup et al. (2005) [1]. 
The latter work shows that it is possible to implement deletions in constant time, without affecting adversely the asymptotic complexity of other operations, 
even when this complexity is calculated as a function of the current size of the set.

In this note we present a conceptual and technical simplification of the algorithm, which has the same theoretical efficiency, and is probably more attractive in practice.
